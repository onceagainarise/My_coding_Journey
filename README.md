Just a lazy person aiming to become like someone

Hi there! I'm Shubham 👋  
This project is a personal roadmap and tracker for my journey to become a better computer vision researcher — inspired by brilliant minds like **Jiahui Yu**.

I’ve always admired how researchers like Jiahui contributed deeply to the field of generative vision models, especially papers like **DeepFill v2**. My goal is to walk a similar path — learning core concepts, reproducing key papers, and eventually doing my own research.

## 🧭 Why This Project?

I built this to track my progress week-by-week as I work through a self-designed curriculum. The idea was simple:

- 📌 Break the learning into realistic weekly chunks  
- 📘 Include key papers, tools, and concepts  
- ✅ Check off each task as I grow my understanding  

The site is static, lightweight, and powered by `localStorage`, so only **I** can see and manage my progress. But it's public to keep me accountable and show others what I’m learning.
Also it helps me to display my progess which i am too lazy to do on github or linkedin .
